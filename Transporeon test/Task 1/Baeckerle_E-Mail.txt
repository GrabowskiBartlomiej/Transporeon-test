Dear Transporeon Team,

Our parameters should be filled from the TRANSPOREON standard format as such:

<EureDransbordNummr>
	Should come from attribute „id“ from /tisys/tour/.
<Uffpassa>
	In case the weight is greater than 20000 in parameter /tisys/tour/tkn_weight, we want the fix value "musch", otherwise "muschnet".
<Liefrung> und <Leifrunga>
	Should work anaolg to „<shipment> and <shipments> in the original format.
<DemseiLiefrungsNummr>
	Should be filled from /tisys/tour/shipments/shipment/number.
<WasDaReiKommt>
	In case there is the value “shippingType” in one of these: /tisys/tour/shipments/shipment/parameters/parameter/qualifier then the first two digits of the corresponding content from the "Value" element should be taken  
<AlleBaramedrZammaZaehlt>
	Should contain the count of all /tisys/tour/shipments/shipment/parameters/parameter elements that belong to the same shipment.

We have attached an example of what we expect as export to our system based on transport 670000001.

All the best from Stuttgart,

Florentina Braun.
